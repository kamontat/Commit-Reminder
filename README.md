# Install Precondition (ON DEVELOP)
I already implement script that will install all needed program and library  
You can find that script at `script/installation`  
BUT I also already add it into main script, so than you just need to click on main file and it will do everything to you.  
`MIGHT BUG`: I don't know that normally macbook has `ruby` installed or not, if not this script should return `error`.
